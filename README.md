# We-Can
Through this project we aim at the following problems to get resolved: 
To provide a digital platform to connect the WeCan club with the community and promote their activities, events, and initiatives. Currently, the club's outreach is limited to local events and physical meetings, making it difficult to reach a wider audience and create a larger impact. By developing a website, the club aims to create a virtual space where members can share information, engage with the community, and collaborate on projects that benefit society. The website must be user-friendly, accessible, and visually appealing to attract a diverse group of people and encourage them to get involved in the club's efforts towards social welfare.
The club conducts regular classes and workshops on various subjects such as science, math, English, and computer literacy, among others. The classes are conducted in NIT Agratala premises itself. The club's volunteers also mentor the students, providing guidance on career choices, college admissions, and other life skills.
The social welfare club's ultimate goal is to empower students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their lives and become active contributors to their communities. By providing access to education and mentorship, the club hopes to create a better future for the students and the villages they come from.
